0,abhaydeep kumar jha,"At this budget, it’s surely a go-to-device! Powerful!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.I’ll update this review after one month of usage."
1,Akash,Wrong charger in the box.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
2,Amazon Customer,The only high configuration laptop under this budget from HP,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
3,Aditya,High Performance packed in a sleek & thin body,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.Update after 2 weeks:After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked."
4,Gnanasekharreddy,Lap top was blast .. you can see the video attached below,1.0 out of 5 stars,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   Don't buy this lap  ... Don't be fool .I spent around 70,000 for the lap, when I open laptop it's screen off and on happening automatically.You can see the video above attached.I request to replacement for the laptop, but not yet got any update.. already completed 15 days."
5,ANI,Mr.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's too strange to see a brand new HP  pavilion laptop got hung in the very second use. None of the keys working....can't even shut down......totally helpless....disappointment at its peak .....The packaging too was no way near the required....Frustration....disappointment....too bad experience.....
6,Abhik,Fantastic ultrabook around 63K INR budget.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.Some closing thoughts:The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!"
7,Manish,Disgusting behaviour by Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not  giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed"
8,Albin Philip,Company is Telling 4.2 GHZ but Actual is 2.4 GHZ,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range
9,dilip mahawar,Excellent Machine,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.
